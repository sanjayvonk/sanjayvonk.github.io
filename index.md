### Conformal Prediction with Prior beliefs for Conditional Coverage
Given a believed distribution of forecasting errors, a researcher or analyst can derive an exact prediction interval. However, if this belief is incorrect, the validity of the prediction interval collapses, making them useless. Conformal Prediction offers an alternative by creating finite sample prediction intervals without relying on any assumptions about the underlying data distribution that provide coverage averaged over all samples. Nevertheless, it is crucial to recognise that this approach does not guarantee coverage on the individual level. For instance, in a medical context, a patient may seek a prediction range for the effectiveness of a drug tailored to their unique characteristics (e.g., age, family history, symptoms) rather than relying on a generalisation for the average patient. This paper proposes a middle ground that attains conditional coverage given a correct prior belief, while still ensuring marginal coverage in the worst case scenario of an incorrect belief. Furthermore, it is shown that approximately accurate priors give coverage guarantees that more closely approximate conditional coverage. This approach encourages the use of prior beliefs in the assumption-free setting without catastrophic results when assumptions fail.
